#LearnOpenGLweb

This is my second personal project which more closely follows tutorials on learnopengl.com.

Here, in this project, I don't care too much about readabiltiy of the code itself. It serves me as a platform I can learn on.

For more readable and updated version of my OpenGL efforts, please visit my second project which is not yet depricated.
